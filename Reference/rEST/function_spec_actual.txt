	Load the specified dataset, returning a DataFrame of incremental
	losses. If ``dataset``=="lrdb", additional keyword arguments are used
	to subset the CAS Loss Reserving Database to the records of interest.
	Within the Loss Reserving Datbase, "loss_key" and "grname" uniquely
	partition losses into 100 record blocks if ``lower_right_ind``=True,
	otherwise losses are partitioned into 55 record blocks. All available
	combinations of "loss_key" and "grcode" (referred to as "specs")
	can be obtained by calling ``get_lrdb_specs``.
	If ``dataset`` is something other than "lrdb", then only the name of
	the target dataset as a string is required.
